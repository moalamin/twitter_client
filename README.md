# Twitter Client

This is a twitter client I wrote to help me gain followers. It is for personal use only. The main functionalities are looking for tweets that have a certain hashtag set by the user. Then, filter the names of the user of those tweets. Follow every user. Then, there is a function that compares my following list to my followers and unfollows those users that do not follow me as well.

The idea is to use this to find users that have tweeted about my interests and follow them. If they follow me back, we will have something in common. It will help me increase twitter followers.
